Summary: Adding governance to the Spin project

Owner: michelle@fermyon.com

Created: June 18, 2024

## Background

Spin is a project now used by many organizations and individuals across the software ecosystem. In order for the Spin community to continue to rely on, build on, and integrate with Spin, there should be a public collective understanding of how the Spin project is governed and how to iterate on governance.

## Proposal

This SIP is a proposal to add a GOVERNANCE.md file (submitted with this SIP) to the root of the Spin repository. The governance structure described in the governance document file aims to describe transparently a process close to how we've been doing things so far in the project and how to make changes. It formally opens up the project for maintainers from multiple organizations, defines maintainership roles, describes decision making processes and more.

The structure outlined in the governance document is established as a temporary bootstrapping phase on the road to a more permanent, multi-stakeholder model. The Spin Governance Committee established in the current governance document should eventually be dismantled and replaced with a smaller, more well defined group only tasked with governing the Spin project as a whole (a "Steering Committee"). This group will in turn establish other committees for handling more specific governance concerns (e.g., Project moderation and CoC enforcement).
